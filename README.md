### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Damien, also known as Tina on the web. I'm a French computer science student at [EPITECH](https://github.com/Epitech/).

## :computer:

Most of my recent experiences are with C, C++ and Python. I also have a long-running background of working with PHP.  
- I like working with the Python web *microframework* [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/), most of my recent personal projects use it
- I have worked with the PHP web framework [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) during a recent internship in 2018-2019
- For graphics, I like using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) when working with C++ or C, and [pyglet](http://pyglet.org/) when working with Python

I consider myself a Linux hobbyist, I'm using Linux fulltime since 2017 as my daily driver. I use it for programming, but also gaming, computer graphics, video editing, and any other daily tasks I do on my computer. I particularly love [Vim](https://vim.org), [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) and tiling window managers. My Linux configuration is available on [my dotfiles repository](https://github.com/skielred/Dotfiles/).

I play various rhythm games, especially arcade ones. They are a niche genre of video games in the west but they are a lot of fun to play. I actually made a few rhythm games related project:
- [osmosis](https://github.com/skielred/osmosis-server) is an alternative score server for the free PC rhythm game osu!: it focuses on accuracy instead of combo
- [LucidSpace](https://github.com/skielred/LucidSpace) is a fork of a skin for USC, a PC clone of the arcade rhythm game SDVX: an attempt at making a feature-complete and beautiful skin that is not rip-off of SDVX
- [KeysManiac](https://github.com/skielred/KeysManiac) is a simple keyboard based rhythm game developped with pyglet
- [SAScrapper](https://github.com/asso-msn/SAScrapper) is a tool to fetch SDVX's Skill Analyzer courses from the website BEMANIWiki 2nd in a machine-readable format
- [coffee break](https://github.com/asso-msn/coffee-break) is a tool to generate good-looking scorecards for any rhythm games, inspired by arcade games

I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz-8GCVEJ0) if you want to get into rhythm games.
